# Digit recognizer kaggle competition solution using PyTorch

Dataset: contains images of handwritten digits.
Task: required top classify images of handwritten digits.
Solution: Classify digits using PyTorch. As the classification model AlexNet convolutional network was used. 

This repository contains the next files:
* output/digit_recognizer.ipynb -- the notebook with the solution, just run it all.
* output/my_submissions.cvs -- predicted image classes. If you run the notebook this file will ber replaced with the new predictions. (ImageId, Label)
* input/digit-recognizer/train.csv -- train dataset. (label, ...pixels)
* input/digit-recognizer/test.csv -- train dataset. (...pixels)
* input/digit-recognizer/sample_submission.csv -- sample submission .(ImageId, Label)
